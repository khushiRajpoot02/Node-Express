if there are multiple to be exported we export it as an object
      eg: module.exports = {jhon, peter};
if only single value, we export simply 
      eg: module.exports = sayHi;
# there are also different way we can export
      module.exports.items = ['item1', 'item2'];
      module.export.singlePerson = singlePerson
      where person = {
        name : "khushi",
      }
There are many inbuilt modules are present in node
    os
    path
we interact with file using ('fs') module
  two ways 
    a. sync-> blocking
    b. async-> non blocking

=> npm -global commands, comes with node
=> npm --version
=> local dependancy - use it only into this perticual project
=> npm i <pakagename>

=> global dependancy - use it in any project
=> npm install -g <pakagename>

=> pakage.json = manifest file (stores imp information about the pakage/project)
=> creating pakage.json = npm inti -y (direct)
for manual - > npm init

=>--------http module------------
console.log("Let's learn Express");
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res)=>{
      console.log("User hit the server");
      res.end("Home page");
})
server.listen(5000);
here we are requesting server with bunch of information and whenever we refresh the server (means hitting the server) it will end response with  
"Home page"
=> pakage.json = manifest file (stores imp information about the pakage/project)
=> creating pakage.json = npm inti -y (direct)
for manual - > npm init

----------------GET POST PUT DELETE--------------
using postman we can test these methods, here we do not need frontend for it
1 GET 
simple route of get methods in postman GET section and click send, it will show the data
2 POST
  write route of post method and go to body, inside body go to raw and json
   and click send button. It will show the added data 

3 DELETE


Key Point: whatever logic we want to write, write inside your method's code(on vs code) and for testing we use postman
